                <h2>Implementation of Findings of the SDC</h2>
                <pre>
1.	If the SDC finds an accused student:

    1.1     guilty, the student is notified in writing of the finding and the sanction(s) imposed by the SDC.  In the Notice, the student is further informed of his/her right to appeal against the finding(s) and/or the sanction(s) imposed;

    1.2	not guilty, the student is notified in writing of the finding of the SDC.

2.       If the student is a minor, no disciplinary measure(s) will be taken against that student before his/her parent or guardian has also been informed in writing of his/her alleged misconduct and has been given a proper opportunity to make a written statement and, if he/she so wishes, to appear before the SDC in person.

3.	A student who has been found guilty of misconduct may, within fourteen calendar days of being informed of the finding of the SDC, appeal to the SDAC in writing by lodging a written Notice of Appeal with the Registrar, provided that a student who has been found guilty of misconduct after having pleaded guilty to the charge against him/her has no right of appeal against such finding, but may still appeal against the sanction.

4.	The appellant furnishes, in writing, detailed grounds for his/her appeal in the Notice of
Appeal.
