                <h2>Sanctions</h2>
                <pre>
1.	When considering an appropriate sanction, the SDC takes account of all mitigating and aggravating factors presented during the hearing.   Further, when considering the appropriateness of the disciplinary measures to be imposed, the SDC ensures that such disciplinary measures are, as far as possible, appropriate to and commensurate with the nature and gravity of the misconduct of which the student has been found guilty.  And still further, it is noted that the SDC is also bound by the rules of administrative law and natural justice and the principles of precedent.

2.       After finding a student guilty of misconduct, the SDC may impose one or more of the following sanctions:

    2.1     revocation of a degree, diploma or other qualification obtained from the University in an improper manner;

    2.2	a written reprimand and/or warning;
    2.3	denial of the opportunity to enrol as a student at the University;

    2.4     a fine not exceeding twice the annual tuition fee for the full first year of study of the qualification for which the student is registered;

    2.5     payment of compensation or requiring the accused student to repair the damage caused by his/her misconduct;

    2.6     denial of the opportunity to register for a particular study module or course offered by the University;

    2.7     annulment of examination results and/or withdrawal of a credit(s) obtained in a study modules and/or courses;

    2.8     confirmation of the temporary suspension of a student, and/or the suspension of the student for a specified period or further period subject to any condition(s) which the SDC deems reasonable;

    2.9     denial of the opportunity to register or enrol again as a student at the University for a specified period;

    2.10   any other appropriate sanction(s) which the SDC deems suitable in the particular circumstances;

3.	A student who is temporarily or permanently deprived in terms of this Code of the opportunity which he/she has as a student or is temporarily or permanently denied admission to the University, forfeits any claim for repayment, reduction or remission of moneys paid or payable to the University.
